    <p>Human life is full of events and moments. Some of these innumerable moments are pleasant, while others are not, and we remember the those for a long time. For me, the most memorable moment was when I thought my world was ending. 
        I thought everything was going to be fine, it was, but it would take a long time for that to happen. It all happened when we got our test results back and I was expecting it but it was still a shock that the test came back positive for covid. My whole family already had a fever and a sore throat, some worse than others; so, we worried. At first, I thought that it would be just like any other cough and cold and that it would be a matter of time before we went back to normal. For a couple days it was like that until my grandma got some severe complications. We decided that it would be best that we took her to the hospital and my mom escorted her. I expected my mom to come back and my grandma would be better in a few days. But I got a call that my mom also had to get admitted. My mom called me and my sister crying and with a raspy voice because she didn’t know if she was ever coming back. My heart sank and I felt like bursting into tears, but I didn’t because I knew I had to be strong and reassure her. There we were just me and my sister home alone and my dad feeling helpless because he was still in US.  By this time, me and my sister were not feeling too good, it felt like a bad case of the flu. I was honestly so scared, it was only me and my sister in the house and we had to cook, clean, take care of ourselves and do schoolwork on top of that. We had a lot of support by our relatives, I was glad we were not in Hyderabad because we had no relatives or help there. We managed by our dad calling us every morning and evening to eat our specific medicine and my uncle flew in to take care of us from the outside. My sister had to literally grow up in 2 weeks. Every time my mom called; I couldn’t help but think what she was going through. Imagine seeing people dying right in front of your eyes with the same condition you had and thinking that it could be you who never sees their kids again. But eventually my mom and my grandma came home, I was so relieved. It felt like I could breathe again, that I could think clearly. 
        Soon we recovered, and what I learned from this experience is that we should never take the time that you have with your family for granted and that the power of positivity goes a long way. I understand that I am not the only one that went through a traumatic experience, many people who got affected lost many of their loved ones and I am so thankful that I was able to recover and be with my family again.
